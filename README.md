# SimpleText-Editor
SimpleText Editor in Java Swing 

My editor app implements a basic editor for files, including:
-- a menuBar with open, save, and openURL options. 
-- a toolBar with open, save, bold, italic iconButtons whereas a comboBox with 
available font types and font sizes.
-- a textArea with available contextualMenu with copy, paste, selectAll and delete
options.
-- an outliner which shows the tree structure of the opened XML file with specific 
icons for expandable, expanded and leaf nodes of the tree, using a customized 
DOMTreeModel.
