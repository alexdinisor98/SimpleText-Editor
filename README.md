# SimpleText-Editor

SimpleText Editor in Java Swing 

My editor app implements a basic editor for files, including:

-- a menuBar with open, save, and openURL options.

-- a toolBar with open, save, bold, italic iconButtons whereas a comboBox
with 
available font types and font sizes.

-- a textArea with available contextualMenu with copy, paste, selectAll 
and delete 
options.

-- an outliner which shows the tree structure of the opened XML file with 
specific 
icons for expandable, expanded and leaf nodes of the tree, using 
a customized 
DOMTreeModel and updates along the user's modifications.

--  a label which notifies the user regarding the errors and warning 
alongside 
his/her modifications of the XML file.

-- XPath expression field which selects the matching nodes 
or node-sets in the opened XML doc.
